#### tips

Brewmaster Monk
Leg Sweep & Ring of Peace both work on the Flamescale Tarasek adds.

You can transcendence over the beams in the intermission.

Vengeance Demon Hunter
You can Sigil of Misery to momentary stop the Flamescale Tarasek adds.

You can Sigil of Chains to grip the Flamescale Tarasek adds together.

It is best to use Fiery Brand at the end of your tanking period as the damage reduction is most impactful at this point.

Protection Paladin
Blessing of Spellwarding works to prevent you from gaining any Burning Wound stacks.

Protection Warrior
-

Guardian Druid
-

Blood Death Knight
Anti-Magic Shell works to prevent you from gaining any Burning Wound stacks. It is best to use this when you are on 0 stacks as any stacks you have currently will eat into the shield making it end early.

Anti-Magic Zone is best used in the intermission whilst the raid is killing a Flame add as this is both the period of highest damage intake.

Death Grip, Abomination Limb and Gorefiends Grasp all work to grip the Flamescale Tarasek adds.
